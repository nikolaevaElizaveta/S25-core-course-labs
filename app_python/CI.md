# CI Best Practices

- **GitHub Actions:** We utilize GitHub Actions for automated testing and building. This ensures that every commit is validated quickly.
- **Linting:** The workflow integrates the flake8 linter to enforce consistent code style and catch potential issues early.
- **Dependency Caching:** We implement caching for dependencies to significantly speed up the build process by avoiding redundant installations.
